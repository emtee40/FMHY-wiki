1. * How are the site's UI, player and search? What sort of user settings does it have?
1. * Does it have watch lists, history or continue watching? Can you login to sync lists across devices?
1. * Any discovery tools like recommendations based on watched content, collections, sorting, AI, etc?
1. * Are new tab/window popups on the site non-existent, slightly irritating, or almost constant?
1. * How is the sites mobile optimization? Does it look good and work well?
1. * Does the site embed content using a custom player, or does it use default API players?
