#### Hugging Face Warning

HuggingFace uses a system called ZeroGPU to manage access to their high-end GPUs. To make sure that their GPUs don't get fully used up, there are limits on how long you can use the GPU on Spaces like this one that utilize ZeroGPU. The rate limit is 120 seconds daily for non-logged in users. You can get around the 120 second limit by changing your IP address, which can be done by using a proxy or VPN while logged out. If you sign up for a free HuggingFace account, you get a much higher 300 second rate limit, but changing your IP won't reset the limit

#### Enhancer for YT Note

Chromium (Chrome and Edge store) uses the latest version of the extension which is V3

This is why we recommend to use on Chromium browsers only.

#### FreeGOGPCGames Note

Many titles on the site are the older versions of the installers. The digital signature on the installer is signed by GOG Limited, which is the old company name before it was merged with GOG Sp. z o.o and all digital file signatures were updated to reflect this name change.
 
The hash does not match the gog-games database because the digital file signatures differ on the installer. Installing either version will produce identical sets of files since the game version remains unchanged.

For a setup guide (including 4k) you can watch this video:

Docs + selfhosting guides can be found here: 
https://docs.pstream.org/

You can also [enable an extension](https://pstream.org/onboarding/extension) / [2](https://github.com/sussy-code/browser-ext/releases/) that will add more sources, but it requires permissions that are somewhat excessive, and the site works fine without it. The extension is safe, and many people use it, the permissions are just needed in order for the [extension to work correctly](https://rentry.co/htagcrv4). 

Note that it can be ran in a new browser or fresh browser profile if you don't want to use your main browser.

(Note: Before downloading it should say Passed at the top left.)
 
Supported devices (0.9) => `https://openrgb.org/devices_0.9.html`
(The link may become outdated after a while, go to the OpenRGB site `https://openrgb.org/index.html` and find the newer one in the menu on the top right.)
