####  NovelAI Bypass

Bypass NovelAI client-side non-account trial limit, mostly just to not have to reset your browser session each time

`localStorage.setItem('localTrialState2', btoa((Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).toString()))`

There will still be IP quota limits, but it's fairly lenient (imo) and if you don't have IPv6 (i think???) then Cloudflare WARP will mask your IP with theirs

#### Enhancer for YT Note

Chromium (Chrome and Edge store) uses the latest version of the extension which is V3

This is why we recommend to use on Chromium browsers only.

#### FreeGOGPCGames Note

Many titles on the site are the older versions of the installers. The digital signature on the installer is signed by GOG Limited, which is the old company name before it was merged with GOG Sp. z o.o and all digital file signatures were updated to reflect this name change.
 
The hash does not match the gog-games database because the digital file signatures differ on the installer. Installing either version will produce identical sets of files since the game version remains unchanged.

You can also [enable an extension](https://pstream.org/onboarding/extension) / [2](https://github.com/sussy-code/browser-ext/releases/) that will add more sources, but the site works fine without it, and it requires excessive permissions, so as a precaution if you are gonna use it, make sure its on a different browser, or new browser profile.

#### OpenRBG Beta

How to download OpenRGB beta.
 
Why?

Go to Gitlab OpenRgb site `https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB` and on the left go to Build => Pipelines and then download the appropriate version from the download button on the top right.
(Note: Before downloading it should say Passed at the top left.)
 
Supported devices (0.9) => `https://openrgb.org/devices_0.9.html`
(The link may become outdated after a while, go to the OpenRGB site `https://openrgb.org/index.html` and find the newer one in the menu on the top right.)
